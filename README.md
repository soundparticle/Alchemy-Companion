# Bootcamp Companion App

## Overview
Bootcamp Companion App is a clean, professional, and easy-to-use site designed to aggregate crowd-sourced data to assist students at Alchemy Code Lab. Currently, students can submit information for 3 different categories: 
* Advice for other students that helped you get through the rigorous curriculum
* coding resources that came in handy time and time again
* and information on local bars or cafes with wifi, happy hour, or quiet spaces

The Bootcamp Companion App was inspired by our desire to produce a product with high utility, and was the result of an intense brainstorming session where we tried to think of tools we, as students, would want to use. 

## Technical Details

### App
The front end of the App was made using Vue components and Vue routers. The final deployment uses Heroku.


The server utilizes Express for the server and PostgreSQL for the database.
